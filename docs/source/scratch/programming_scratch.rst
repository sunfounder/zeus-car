Programming with Scratch
============================

Ready to dive into the exciting world of graphical programming? Besides using the Arduino IDE, you can unleash your creativity with Scratch!

We highly recommend using **Scratch** for programming, but since the official Scratch only supports Raspberry Pi, we've got you covered. Introducing **Mammoth Coding**â€”a graphical programming software based on Scratch 3, specially designed for Arduino boards like the Uno, Mega2560, and Nano.

**Mammoth Coding** retains all the core features of Scratch 3 while adding the ability to control various boards such as Arduino Uno, Mega, and custom Nano boards. It empowers you to use external sensors and robots to control sprites on the stage, offering robust hardware interaction capabilities.

The best part? This app is super user-friendly, even if you're new to programming. You'll be able to learn and utilize these cutting-edge technologies with ease.

Simply drag and drop Scratch coding blocks to create thrilling games, animations, interactive projects, and even control robots just the way you envision!

So, let's embark on this exciting journey together!
