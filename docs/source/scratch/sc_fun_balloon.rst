1. Inflating the Balloon
=========================================

In this interactive project, we control a balloon's flight.

Upon clicking the green flag, the balloon will progressively inflate. If the balloon becomes too large, it will burst; if too small, it will fall. Your task is to block the left infrared module at the right moment to make it ascend.

Below are the steps for implementing the project. It is advisable to follow these steps initially, and once familiar, you may alter the effects as desired.


1. Add a Sprite and a Backdrop
----------------------------------------

* Remove the default sprite and click the **Choose a Sprite** button in the bottom-right corner of the sprite area. Then, select the **Balloon1** sprite.

* Add a **Boardwalk** backdrop or another backdrop of your choice through the **Choose a Backdrop** button.

2. Paint a Costume for the **Balloon1** Sprite
-------------------------------------------------------

Now, let's create an exploding effect costume for the balloon.

* Navigate to the **Costumes** tab for the **Balloon1** sprite, click the **Choose a Costume** button in the bottom left, and select **Paint** to open a blank **Costume**. Name it "boom".

* Choose a color and use the **Brush** tool to draw a pattern.

    :width: 90%

* Choose another color, select the **Fill** tool, and tap inside the pattern to fill it.

    :width: 90%

* Finally, add the text "BOOM" to complete the explosion effect costume.

3. Scripting the **Balloon** Sprite
------------------------------------------

* Initialize the **Balloon1** sprite's position and size.

  .. image:: img/balloon_script1.png

* Gradually increase the size of the **Balloon** sprite.

  .. image:: img/balloon_script2.png

* At this point, block the left obstacle avoidance module to stop the **Balloon1** sprite from inflating further.

  .. image:: img/balloon_script3.png

* Now, let the **Balloon1** sprite decide whether to ascend or descend based on its size.

  * If the size is less than 90, it will descend (y-coordinate decreases).
  * If the size is between 90 and 120, it will ascend (y-coordinate increases).

  .. image:: img/balloon_script4.png

* If you fail to block the left obstacle avoidance module, the balloon will continue to inflate until it exceeds a size of 120, at which point it will explode (switch to the explosion effect costume).

Programming is complete. You can now click the green flag to run the script and see if it achieves the desired effect.
