5. Fishing
===========================

Dive into our interactive fishing game, utilizing the left obstacle avoidance module for an engaging experience.

When the script is active, fish will swim back and forth across the stage. To catch a fish, you must block the left obstacle avoidance module just as the fish is about to pass the hook. The game automatically records the number of fish you catch.

Follow these initial steps to set up the project, and feel free to customize the effects once you are familiar with the setup.

1. Add Background and Sprites
------------------------------------

First, select an **Underwater** backdrop, then add a **Fish** sprite and let it swim across the stage.

* Use the **Choose a Backdrop** button to select an **Underwater** backdrop.

* Delete the original sprite, then select the **Fish** sprite.

  .. image:: img/fish_choose_fish.png

* Adjust the size and position of the **Fish** sprite.

2. Draw a **Fishhook** Sprite
-------------------------------------

Next, create a **Fishhook** sprite, which you will control via the left obstacle avoidance module to start fishing.

* Add the **Glow-J** sprite via **Choose a Sprite** and rename it "Fishhook".

  .. image:: img/fish_choose_j.png

* Navigate to the **Costumes** page of the **Glow-J** sprite, rename it **Fishhook**, select the internal white 'J', and change its color to red.

* Remove the outer cyan fill and reduce its width. Ensure the top of the hook aligns with the center point.

* Use the **Line tool** to draw a line extending upward from the center point, extending out of the stage.

3. Scripting for the **Fish** Sprite
---------------------------------------

The **Fish** sprite should move left and right on the stage, and when it interacts with the **Fishhook** sprite in the fishing state, it should shrink, move to a specific position, then disappear, followed by the spawning of a new **Fish** sprite.

* Create a variable **score** to store the number of fish caught, hide this sprite, and clone it.

  .. image:: img/fish_script_fish1.png

* Display the clone of the **Fish** sprite, switch its costume, and set the initial position.

  .. image:: img/fish_script_fish2.png

* Enable the clone of the **Fish** sprite to move left and right and bounce back when touching the stage's edge.

  .. image:: img/fish_script_fish3.png

* If the clone of the **Fish** sprite touches the **Fishhook** sprite in the fishing state (when it turns red).

  .. image:: img/fish_script_fish4.png
    :width: 90%

* Increase the score (variable score) by 1, show a scoring animation (shrinks by 40%, quickly moves to the scoreboard's position and disappears). Simultaneously, create a new fish (a new **Fish** sprite clone) and continue the game.

4. Scripting for the **Fishhook** Sprite
---------------------------------------------

The **Fishhook** sprite generally stays underwater in a yellow state. When your hand blocks the left-side infrared module, it changes to the fishing state (red) and moves above the stage.

* When the green flag is clicked, set the sprite's color effect to 30 (yellow) and set its initial position.

  .. image:: img/fish_script_hook1.png

* When your hand blocks the left-side infrared module, set the color effect to 0 (red, initiating the fishing state), wait for 0.1 seconds, then move the **Fishhook** sprite to the top of the stage.

  .. image:: img/fish_script_hook2.png

* After removing your hand, let the **Fishhook** return to its initial position.

Once you've completed programming, click the green flag to run the script and see if it achieves the desired effect.
