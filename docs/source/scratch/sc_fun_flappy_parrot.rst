2. Flappy Parrot
==============================

In this project, we utilize an ultrasonic module to play a flappy parrot game.

After starting the script, the green bamboo (Paddle) will move from right to left at a random height. To control the parrot, place your hand above the ultrasonic module. If the distance between your hand and the module is less than 10cm, the parrot will ascend; otherwise, it will descend. You must manage this distance carefully to help the Parrot navigate past the green bamboo. Contact with the bamboo ends the game.

Below are the steps for implementing the project. It is recommended to follow these steps initially, and once familiar, you may alter the effects as desired.

1. Add Sprites
---------------------------

* Delete the default sprite and use the **Choose a Sprite** button to add the **Parrot** sprite. Set its size to 50% and position it on the bottom left corner.

* Add the **Paddle** sprite, set its size to 150%, rotate it to 180 degrees, and position it in the top right corner.

* Navigate to the **Costumes** page of the **Paddle** sprite, select the **Paddle** on the canvas, and then click the **Outline** tool.

* Change the outline effect to full fill mode and use the removal tool to eliminate it.

2. Scripting for the **Parrot** Sprite
---------------------------------------------

Script the **Parrot** sprite to simulate its flight, with altitude adjustments based on the ultrasonic module's detection distance.

* When the green flag is clicked, switch the costume every 0.2 seconds to maintain the appearance of flight.

* If the ultrasonic detection distance is less than 10cm, increase the y-coordinate by 50, causing the **Parrot** to ascend. Otherwise, decrease the y-coordinate by 40, causing the **Parrot** to descend.

* If the **Parrot** sprite makes contact with the **Paddle** sprite, the game ends, and the script ceases execution.

3. Scripting for the **Paddle** Sprite
-----------------------------------------------

Script the **Paddle** sprite to appear randomly on stage.

* Hide the **Paddle** sprite when the green flag is clicked and simultaneously create a clone of itself. The [`create clone of <https://en.scratch-wiki.info/wiki/Create_Clone_of_()_(block)>`_] block controls this cloning process.

  .. image:: img/parrot_script_paddle1.png

* Set the clone's position with the x-coordinate at 220 (rightmost) and the y-coordinate randomly between (-125 to 125).

  .. image:: img/parrot_script_paddle2.png

* Use the [repeat] block to gradually decrease its x-coordinate, making the clone move slowly from right to left until it disappears.

* Re-clone a new **Paddle** sprite and delete the previous clone.

Programming is complete. You can now click the green flag to run the script and see if it achieves the desired effect.
