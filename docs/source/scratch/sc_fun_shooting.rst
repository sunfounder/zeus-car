3. Shooting
====================================

Ever watched those thrilling shooting games on TV, where contestants expertly target the bullseye to rack up points? Now, you can experience the same adrenaline rush right here in Scratch! In our interactive shooting game, you'll use the Crosshair sprite to aim and hit as close to the bullseye as possible, maximizing your score with each precise shot.

To begin, click the green flag. You'll control your shots using the innovative Obstacle Avoidance module. Ready to test your aim and reflexes? Let‚Äôs see how you score!

Below are the steps for implementing the project. It is recommended to follow these steps initially, and once familiar, you may modify the effects as desired.

1. Paint the **Crosshair** sprite
----------------------------------------------

* Delete the default sprite, select the **Sprite** button, and click **Paint**.

  .. image:: img/shooting_paint_cross.png

* Proceed to the **Costumes** page. Use the **Circle** tool, remove the fill color, and set the outline's color and width.

  .. image:: img/shooting_paint_cross1.png

* Draw a circle with the **Circle** tool. After drawing, use the **Select** tool to align the circle's center with the canvas's center.

* With the **Line** tool, draw a cross inside the circle.

* Finally, return to the **Code** page and rename the sprite to ‚ÄúCrosshair‚Äù.

2. Paint the **Target** sprite
----------------------------------------

* Similarly, select the **Sprite** button and click **Paint**.

  .. image:: img/shooting_paint_target1.png

* Enter the **Costumes** page. Use the **Circle** tool, select a black color, remove the Outline, and paint a large circle.

  .. image:: img/shooting_paint_target3.png
    :width: 90%

* Draw additional circles using the same method, each in a different color. Adjust the position of overlapping circles using the **Forward** or **Backward** tool to ensure all circles' origins align with the canvas's center.

* Return to the **Code** page and rename this sprite "Target".

3. Add a backdrop
--------------------------

* Add a suitable backdrop that is preferably less colorful and does not match the colors of the **Target** sprite. I have chosen the **Wall1** backdrop.

  .. image:: img/shooting_choose_backdrop.png

* Adjust the positions and sizes of the **Target** and **Crosshair** sprites.

  .. note::

    * Ensure the **Crosshair** sprite is layered above the **Target** sprite by moving the **Target** sprite first and then the **Crosshair**.
    * The **Crosshair** should be smaller than the space between the color rings of the **Target** sprite.

4. Script the **Crosshair** sprite
---------------------------------------

* Randomize the position and size of the **Crosshair** sprite, allowing it to move unpredictably.

  .. image:: img/shooting_script_cross.png

* When the left obstacle avoidance module is blocked, a message is broadcast - shooting.

  .. image:: img/shooting_script_cross1.png

* When the **shooting** message is received, the sprite stops moving and gradually shrinks, simulating the shooting of a bullet.

  .. image:: img/shooting_script_cross2.png

* Use the [Touch color ()] block to determine the shot's position.

  .. image:: img/shooting_script_cross3.png
    :width: 90%

* Report a score of 10 if the shot lands inside the yellow circle.

  .. image:: img/shooting_script_cross4.png

* Report a score of 9 if the shot lands inside the red circle. Similarly, use the [Touch color ()] block to match the color of the red circle.

  .. image:: img/shooting_script_cross5.png
    :width: 90%

* Use the same method to confirm the bullet's landing. If it does not land on the **Target** sprite, it indicates a miss.

Programming is complete. You can now click the green flag to run the script and see if it achieves the desired effect.
