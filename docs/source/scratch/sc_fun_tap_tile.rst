7. Tap on The Black Tile
==========================================

Many of you are familiar with the popular mobile game where players tap on the black tiles to score points while avoiding the white tiles. We're bringing this addictive challenge using two obstacle avoidance modules. When your hand is blocked over one of the IR modules, a tap is registered on the stage.

If a tap lands on a black tile, you score a point; tapping a white tile deducts a point. Players must decide quickly whether to tap over the left or right IR module based on the position of the black tiles.

Below are the steps for implementing the project. It is recommended to follow these steps initially, and once familiar, you may modify the effects as desired.

1. Paint a **Tile** sprite
-----------------------------------

A **Tile** sprite is used to achieve the effect of alternating black and white tiles moving downward; in the cell phone version of this game, there are generally 4 columns, here we only do two columns.


* Delete the default sprite, tap on the **Add Sprite** icon, select **Paint**.

  .. image:: img/tile_paint_tile1.png

* Next, go to the **Costumes** page and use the **Rectangle** tool to draw a rectangle with a gray border and white fill.

  .. image:: img/tile_paint_tile2.png
    :width: 90%

* Select the rectangle and click **Copy** -> **Paste** to make an identical rectangle, then move the two rectangles to a flush position.

  .. image:: img/tile_paint_tile3.png
    :width: 90%

* Select one of the rectangles and choose a fill color of black.

  .. image:: img/tile_paint_tile4.png
    :width: 90%

* Now select both rectangles and move them so that their center points match the center of the canvas.

  .. image:: img/tile_paint_tile5.png
    :width: 90%

* Duplicate costume1, alternating the fill colors of the two rectangles. For example, the fill color of costume1 is white on the left and black on the right, and the fill color of costume2 is black on the left and white on the right.

    :width: 90%

* Return to the **Code** page and set the sprite's name to **Tile**.

2. Scripting the **Tile** sprite
-------------------------------------

* First, set the initial position of the **Tile** sprite so that it is at the top of the stage.

  .. image:: img/tile_script_tile1.png

* Create a variable - **blocks** and give it an initial value to determine the number of times the **Tile** sprite will appear. Use the [repeat until] block to make the variable **blocks** gradually decrease until **blocks** is 0. During this time, have the sprite **Tile** randomly switch its costume. After clicking on the green flag, you will see the **Tile** sprite on the stage quickly switch costumes.

  .. image:: img/tile_script_tile2.png

* Create clones of the **Tile** sprite while the variable **blocks** is decreasing, and stop the script from running when blocks is 0. Two [wait () seconds] blocks are used here, the first to limit the interval between **Tile's** clones and the second is to let the variable blocks decrease to 0 without stopping the program immediately, giving the last tile sprite enough time to move.

  .. image:: img/tile_script_tile3.png

* Now script the clone of the **Tile** sprite to move down slowly and delete it when it reaches the bottom of the stage. The change in the y coordinate affects the drop speed, the larger the value, the faster the drop speed.

  .. image:: img/tile_script_tile4.png

* Hide the body and show the clone.

  .. image:: img/tile_script_tile5.png

3. Scripting the backdrop
-------------------------------

In the backdrop, read the values of the 2 IR modules and make the corresponding actions.

* When the green flag is clicked, set the variable **count** to 0.

  .. image:: img/tile_script_backdrop.png
    :width: 90%

* If the left IR obstacle avoidance module senses your hand, broadcast a message - **left**. 

  .. image:: img/tile_script_backdrop1.png


* If the right IR avoidance module senses your hand, broadcast a message - **right**.

  .. image:: img/tile_script_backdrop2.png


4. Paint **Left IR** sprite
-----------------------------
A **Left IR** sprite is used to achieve the click effect; when the left IR module senses your hand, it will send a message - **left** to **Left IR** sprite, letting it start working. If it touches the black tile on the stage, the score will be increased by 1, otherwise, the score will be decreased by 1.


* Again, tap on the **Add Sprite** icon and select **Paint**.

  .. image:: img/tile_paint_ir1.png

* Go to the **Costumes** page, select the fill color (any color out of black and white) and draw a circle.

  .. image:: img/tile_paint_ir2.png

* Return to the **Code** page and change the sprite's name to **Left IR**.

  .. image:: img/tile_paint_ir3.png

5. Scripting the **Left IR** sprite
------------------------------------------

* Now start scripting the **Left IR** sprite. When the green flag is clicked, first hide the sprite.

  .. image:: img/tile_script_ir1.png

* When the message - **left** is received (the IR receiver module on the left detects an obstacle), show the sprite, set its size to 100%, and then shrink it at intervals of 10 using a [Repeat] block before hiding it again. This gives the sprite an effect of expanding and contracting.

  .. image:: img/tile_script_ir2.png

* Then determine if the black block of the **Tile** sprite is touched, and if it is, let the variable **count** increase by 1, otherwise decrease by 1.
  
  .. image:: img/tile_script_ir3.png

.. note::

    You need to make the **Tile** sprite appear on the stage, and then absorb the color of the black block in the **Tile** sprite.

    .. image:: img/tile_script_ir4.png

6. **Right IR** sprite
-------------------------------------
The function of **Right IR** sprite is basically the same as **Left IR**, except that it receives **Right** information.


* Now duplicate the **Left IR** sprite and change the sprite's name to **Right IR**.

  .. image:: img/tile_paint_ir4.png

* Then change the received message to - **right**.

    .. image:: img/tile_script_ir5.png

7. Running the Script
---------------------------------

* Now adjust the positions and sizes of the three sprites.

  * Drag the **Tile** sprite to the bottom of the stage and set its x position to 0.
  * Move the **Left IR** sprite into the left frame. You need to go to the **Costumes** page to reduce the sprite's size to only 50% of the frame's size.
  * Similarly, move the **Right IR** sprite into the right frame. You need to go to the **Costumes** page to reduce the sprite's size to only 50% of the frame's size.
  * Make sure that the **Left IR** and **Right IR** sprites are above the **Tile** sprite.

  .. image:: img/tile_paint_ir5.png

* Now all the scripting is done, and you can click on the green flag to run the script.
