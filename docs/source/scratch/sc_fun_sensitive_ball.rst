6. Distance Sensitive Ball
==============================

In this project, we utilize an ultrasonic module to control the vertical movement of a ball on the stage. When you click the green flag, place your hand above the ultrasonic module. The ball will ascend if the distance between your hand and the module is less than 15 cm; otherwise, it will descend. When the ball makes contact with a line, it triggers a delightful sound and activates twinkling starlight effects.

Follow these steps to set up the project, and feel free to tweak the effects to your liking once you're accustomed to how it works.

1. Select Sprites
--------------------------

* Remove the default sprite and select the **Ball**, **Bowl**, and **Star** sprites.

  .. image:: img/ball_choose_sprite.png

* Position the **Bowl** sprite at the center bottom of the stage and increase its size.

  .. image:: img/ball_set_bowl.png

* Place the **Ball** sprite directly above the **Bowl** sprite, setting its direction to 0 to allow vertical movement.

* Adjust the **Star** spriteâ€™s size and set its direction to 180 to ensure it falls downward. This can be altered to different angles if preferred.

* Add the **Stars** backdrop for added ambiance.

2. Draw a **Line** Sprite
-------------------------------

* Now add a **Line** sprite.

  .. image:: img/ball_select_line.png

* Navigate to the **Costumes** page of the **Line** sprite.

    :width: 90%

* Slightly reduce the width of the red line on the canvas, duplicate it four times, and align these lines.

    :width: 90%

* Color each line differently. Select a line, use the **Fill** tool, and pick a color.

  .. image:: img/ball_set_bk_color.png
    :width: 90%

* Apply this method to color all lines accordingly.

  .. image:: img/ball_select_line_color.png
    :width: 90%

* Return to the **Code** page and position the **Line** sprite at the top of the stage.

3. Scripting the **Ball** Sprite
-------------------------------------

Here, we script the **Ball** sprite to move up or down based on the distance detected by the ultrasonic module, with a movement constraint to simulate landing on the **Bowl** sprite.

* When the green flag is clicked, set the initial position of the **Ball** sprite.

  .. image:: img/ball_script_ball1.png

* Use an [if else] block to check if the distance is less than 15. If true, move the **Ball** sprite up by 10 steps, given its direction is set to 0.

  .. image:: img/ball_script_ball3.png

* Otherwise, let the **Ball** sprite fall, limiting its Y coordinate to a minimum of -100, adjustable to appear as though itâ€™s landing on the **Bowl** sprite.

  .. image:: img/ball_script_ball4.png

* Script interaction where the **Ball** sprite, upon touching the **Line** sprite, records its Y position to the variable **ball_coor** and broadcasts a **bling** message.

4. Scripting the **Star** Sprite
------------------------------------

* Initially hide the **Star** sprite when the green flag is clicked. Upon receiving the **Bling** message, clone the **Star** sprite.

  .. image:: img/ball_script_star1.png

* Set the clone's position and sound effects to synchronize with the **Ball** sprite's position.

  .. image:: img/ball_script_star2.png

* Allow it to rotate between -80 to 80 degrees randomly.

  .. image:: img/ball_script_star3.png

* Adjust the appearance and behavior of the **Star** sprite as needed to enhance the visual effect.

Programming is complete. Click the green flag to run the script and see if it meets your expectations.
