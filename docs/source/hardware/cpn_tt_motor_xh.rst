This is a TT DC motor with a gear ratio of 1:48, it comes with 2 x 250mm wires with XH2.54-2P connector.

You can power these motors with 3 ~ 6VDC, but of course, they will go a little faster at higher voltages.

Note that these are very basic motors with no built-in encoder, speed control or position feedback. The voltage goes in and the spin comes out. There will be variation from motor to motor, so if you need precise motion, you'll need a separate feedback system.
