**What is Mecanum Wheel?**

The Mecanum Wheel is an omnidirectional wheel design for a land-based vehicle to move in any direction. 
It is sometimes called the Swedish wheel or Ilon wheel after its inventor.

The Mecanum Wheel is a form of tireless wheel, with a series of rubberized external rollers obliquely attached to the 
whole circumference of its rim. These rollers typically each have an axis of rotation at 45Â° to the wheel plane and at 45Â° to the axle line.

Each Mecanum wheel is an independent non-steering drive wheel with its own powertrain, and when spinning generates a propelling 
force perpendicular to the roller axle, which can be vectored into a longitudinal and a transverse component in relation to the vehicle.

The Mecanum Wheel can be divided into left-hand and right-hand wheels that are mirror images of each other, depending on the angle of 45Â°.
