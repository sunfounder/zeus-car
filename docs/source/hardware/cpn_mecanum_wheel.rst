The Mecanum Wheel is an omnidirectional wheel design for a land-based vehicle to move in any direction. 
It is sometimes called the Swedish wheel or Ilon wheel after its inventor.

The Mecanum Wheel is a form of tireless wheel, with a series of rubberized external rollers obliquely attached to the 
whole circumference of its rim. These rollers typically each have an axis of rotation at 45째 to the wheel plane and at 45째 to the axle line.

Each Mecanum wheel is an independent non-steering drive wheel with its own powertrain, and when spinning generates a propelling 
force perpendicular to the roller axle, which can be vectored into a longitudinal and a transverse component in relation to the vehicle.

The Mecanum Wheel can be divided into left-hand and right-hand wheels that are mirror images of each other, depending on the angle of 45째.
