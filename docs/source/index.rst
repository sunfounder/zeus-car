* Using 6cm Mecanum Wheel, easy to achieve 360 Â° omnidirectional movement, and can perform difficult movements such as left and right drift.
* Equipped with ESP32 CAM, you can experience first-person driving on the APP.
* With 2 obstacle avoidance modules and an ultrasonic module, it can realize obstacle avoidance and following function.
* The bottom is mounted with an 8-channel circularly placed grayscale module, which allows the car to follow the line in any direction.
* There are also IR remote control and cool lighting effects, etc.
* Module interfaces are XH1.5, easy to assemble and less chance of error.

We set a :ref:`ar_play_mode` for it, so users can directly turn on the car after assembling it and play with its various cool functions with its own remote control or mobile APP. In case you want to learn more about how to implement its various functions, you can refer to the :ref:`ar_programming_mode`.
