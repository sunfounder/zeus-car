How to Change Wi-Fi Channel?
----------------------------------

The 2.4GHz Wi-Fi band has channels ranging from 1 to 13. ESP32 supports channels 1 to 11. Other devices operating on the same channel may cause interference, leading to connection issues. To mitigate this, you can try changing the channel. By default, the channel is set to 1. When selecting a new channel, itâ€™s recommended to skip 1-2 channels at a time. For example, if the current channel is 1, try channel 3 first, and if the signal is still poor, proceed to channel 5.

.. note::

   ESP32 CAM firmware version 1.4.1 or above is required to change channels. Refer to :ref:`update_firmware` for more details.

#. Keep the ESP32 CAM inserted into the adapter, then power on the Zeus Car.

.. _upload_zeus_code:

How to Upload the ``zeus-car.ino`` Code?
-----------------------------------------------

By default, the Zeus Car's Uno R3 board comes preloaded with the necessary firmware, allowing you to control it via APP. If your R3 board has been overwritten with other code, but you'd like to return to the default firmware and continue with the :ref:`quick_start` process, follow these steps to re-upload the code to your R3 board:

#. Use a USB cable to connect the Arduino to your computer. The ESP32-CAM and the Arduino board share the same RX (receive) and TX (transmit) pins. So, when you're uploading code, you'll need to first disconnect the ESP32-CAM to avoid any conflicts or potential issues.
   
   .. image:: img/unplug_cam.png
        :width: 400

#. Download the required firmware from the link below: 
        
   * :download:`R3 Board Firmware File <https://github.com/sunfounder/zeus-car/releases/download/1.4.5/zeus-car-1.4.5.zip>`

#. Extract the downloaded zip file, then double-click the ``update-arduino-firmware.bat`` file to run it.

   .. image:: img/faq_firmware_file.png

#. Type the corresponding number for your Zeus Car's Arduino Uno (e.g., ``1``) and press **Enter** to begin the update.


   .. note::

     * If the correct COM port does not appear, or if you're unsure which one it is, disconnect other USB devices from your computer, leaving only the rover connected.  
     * If you encounter an error like ``avrdude.exe: stk500_getsync() attempt 1 of 10: not in sync: resp=0xXX``, make sure to disconnect the ESP32-CAM as the first step.

   .. image:: img/faq_firmware_port.png

#. After a short while, the new code will be successfully uploaded to the Uno R3 board on Zeus Car. If you fail to upload successfully after multiple attempts, you can run ``update-arduino-firmware-with-bootloader.bat``.
