FAQ
================

Q1: Compilation error: SoftPWM.h: No such file or directory?
--------------------------------------------------------------


If you get a "Compilation error: SoftPWM.h: No such file or directory" prompt, it means you don't have the ``SoftPWM`` library installed.

Please refer to :ref:`ar_install_library` to install the two required libraries ``SoftPWM`` and ``IRLremote``.


Q2: avrdude: stk500_getsync() attempt 10 of 10: not in sync: resp=0x6e?
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

If the following message keeps appearing after clicking the Upload button when the board and port have been selected correctly.

.. code-block::

    avrdude: stk500_recv(): programmer is not responding
    avrdude: stk500_getsync() attempt 1 of 10: not in sync: resp=0x00
    avrdude: stk500_recv(): programmer is not responding
    avrdude: stk500_getsync() attempt 2 of 10: not in sync: resp=0x00
    avrdude: stk500_recv(): programmer is not responding
    avrdude: stk500_getsync() attempt 3 of 10: not in sync: resp=0x00

At this point, you need to make sure that the ESP32 CAM is unplugged.

The ESP32-CAM and the Arduino board share the same RX (receive) and TX (transmit) pins. So, when you're uploading code, you'll need to first disconnect the ESP32-CAM to avoid any conflicts or potential issues.

Q3: How can I use the STT feature on my Android device?
------------------------------------------------------------------------

The STT feature requires the Android mobile device to be connected to the Internet and to install the **Google service component**.

Now follow the steps below.

#. Modify the AP mode of ``Zeus_Car.ino`` file to STA mode.

    * Open the the ``Zeus_Car.ino`` file located in the ``zeus-car-main/Zeus_Car`` directory. 
    * Then comment out the AP mode related code. Uncomment the STA mode related code and fill in  the ``SSD`` and ``PASSWORD`` of your home Wi-Fi.

        .. code-block:: arduino

            /** Configure Wifi mode, SSID, password*/
            // #define WIFI_MODE WIFI_MODE_AP
            // #define SSID "Zeus_Car"
            // #define PASSWORD "12345678"

            #define WIFI_MODE WIFI_MODE_STA
            #define SSID "xxxxxxxxxx"
            #define PASSWORD "xxxxxxxxxx"

    * Save this code, select the correct board (Arduino Uno) and port, then click the **Upload** button to upload it to the R3 board.

#. Search ``google`` in Google Play, find the app shown below and install it.

#. Connect your mobile device to the same Wi-Fi as you wrote in the code.

#. Open the controller previously created in SunFounder Controller and connect it to ``Zeus_Car`` through the |app_connect| button.

#. Tap and hold the |app_speech_m|  widget after clicking the |app_run| button. A prompt will appear indicating that it is listening. Say the following command to move the car.

    * ``stop``: All movements of the car can be stopped.
    * ``pasue``: The function is basically the same as Stop, but if the head of the car is not facing the direction originally set, it will slowly move to the set direction.
    * ``forward`` 
    * ``backward`` 
    * ``left forward``
    * ``left backward``
    * ``right forward``
    * ``right backward``
    * ``move left``
    * ``move right``
