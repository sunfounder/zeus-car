Programming with Arduino IDE
=============================

After you have experienced :ref:`quick_start_app_remote`, if you want to understand how each function is implemented, and then modify the effect according to your own ideas, you can come to read this programming mode carefully.

Every function in the programming mode chapter is made into a separate project, there are 17 of them. Each project has corresponding code and explanation, so you can see how each function works.

This project uses the Arduino programming language, so you'll need to install the Arduino IDE and related libraries before you can begin.

Now let's start the journey of discovery!
