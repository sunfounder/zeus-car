**How to do?**

#. The ESP32-CAM and the Arduino board share the same RX (receive) and TX (transmit) pins. So, when you're uploading code, you'll need to first disconnect the ESP32-CAM to avoid any conflicts or potential issues.

        :width: 400
        :align: center


#. Open the ``6_car_light.ino`` file under the path of ``zeus-car-main\examples\6_car_light``.

    .. raw:: html

#. After the code is uploaded successfully, slide the power switch to ON to start the Zeus Car.

#. Now you can use the numbers 1 to 9 on the remote control to control the car to light up different colors, press 0 to turn off, press |ir_return| to let the car perform a color cycle. Key 1 to 9 corresponding to the color is: red, orange, yellow, green, cyan, blue, purple, pink, white.
