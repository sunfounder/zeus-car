11. Obstacle Avoidance
================================

In this project, the Zeus car will move forward automatically, and two obstacle avoidance modules and an ultrasonic module will prevent it from hitting obstacles.

**How to do?**

#. The ESP32-CAM and the Arduino board share the same RX (receive) and TX (transmit) pins. So, when you're uploading code, you'll need to first disconnect the ESP32-CAM to avoid any conflicts or potential issues.

#. Open the ``11_obstacle_avoid.ino`` file under the path of ``zeus-car-main\examples\11_obstacle_avoid``.

#. After the code is uploaded successfully, slide the power switch to ON to start the Zeus Car.

    * Zeus car will move forward.
    * An ultrasonic module detects obstacles in front, if detected, the car turns left.
    * When the left obstacle avoidance module detects an obstacle, the car turns right, and when the right obstacle avoidance module detects an obstacle, the car turns left.

.. note::
    Before use, you need to adjust the detection distance of the two obstacle avoidance modules to 15CM, the steps are as follows

    * Place an obstacle about 15cm away from the IR obstacle avoidance module.
    * On the module are two potentiometers, one to adjust the sending power and one to adjust the sending frequency. By adjusting these two potentiometers, you can adjust the detection distance.
    * Then you can adjust a potentiometer, and if at 15cm, the signal light on the module illuminates, the adjustment is successful; if it doesn't, adjust another potentiometer.

    * Calibrate the other obstacle avoidance module in the same way.
