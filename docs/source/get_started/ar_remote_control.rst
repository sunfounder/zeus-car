**How to do?**

#. The ESP32-CAM and the Arduino board share the same RX (receive) and TX (transmit) pins. So, when you're uploading code, you'll need to first disconnect the ESP32-CAM to avoid any conflicts or potential issues.

#. Open the ``5_remote_control.ino`` file under the path of ``zeus-car-main\examples\5_remote_control``.

#. After the code is uploaded successfully, turn the power switch to ON to start the Zeus Car. 

#. Then use the 1~9 on the remote control to control the car in 8 directions.
