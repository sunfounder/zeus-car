Quick Play with APP or IR Remote Control
==============================================

In **Quick Start Mode**, your Zeus Car comes pre-loaded with code on the Arduino board right from the factory. This means you can start controlling it immediately using the mobile app or the included remote control as soon as it's turned on.

* :ref:`play_app_control`: Install the SunFounder Controller app on your mobile phone or tablet. This app allows you to control the Zeus Car in all directions with a joystick widget, use speech control, and most importantly, view real-time video streaming from the car's camera.
* :ref:`play_remote_control`: We've included a simple remote control. Just turn on the Zeus Car, and you can control it directly. This is a great option for users who want to experience the fun of controlling the Zeus Car as soon as possible.


.. note::  

    If your R3 board is programmed with other code and you wish to control the Zeus Car via the app or the remote control quickly, follow the steps in :ref:`upload_zeus_code`.
